# To-Do List Application with Tkinter

This is a simple To-Do List application built with Python's `tkinter` library. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to manage tasks with functionalities to add, delete, and clear tasks.

## Features

- Add new tasks to the list
- Delete selected tasks from the list
- Clear all tasks from the list

## Installation

To run this application, you need Python 3.x installed on your system. `tkinter` comes bundled with Python, so no additional installation is required.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo_list_gui.git
   cd todo_list_gui
   ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

## Running the Application

Run the application using the following command:

```sh
python todo_list_gui.py
```

A window will appear with the To-Do List application interface. You can:

- **Add Task**: Enter a task description and click "Add Task" to add it to the list.
- **Delete Task**: Select a task from the list and click "Delete Task" to remove it.
- **Clear All Tasks**: Click "Clear All Tasks" to remove all tasks from the list.

## Customization

- **Modify GUI**: Edit `todo_list_gui.py` to change the layout, colors, or add new features.
- **Add Functionality**: Extend the application to save tasks to a file or integrate with a database.

## Troubleshooting

- **No GUI Window Appears**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed and `tkinter` is properly configured.
- **Error Messages**: Check that the file `todo_list_gui.py` is executed correctly and that Python is installed correctly.
